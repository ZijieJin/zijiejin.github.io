### Research Directions

1. Statistics: I am particularly interested in developing statistics methods and theories for big data motivated by the problems coming from biological and medical researches.
2. Bioinformatics: I am also interesred in developing statistics and machine learning methods for high-throughput sequencing data. I recently focus on developing computational methods for single cell data and third generation sequencing data.
3. Tumor omics study and precision medicine: I analyze large-scale tumor omics data to reveal important molecular patterns of tumor and its microenvironments. I am also trying to build statistics or machine learning models that are predictive for patient’s prognostics or responses to cancer treatments.

### 心得体会

做学术最关键的就是要沉住气，遇到难题不要怕，敢于尝试，勤于思考，努力从复杂的数据中获得有价值的信息！
